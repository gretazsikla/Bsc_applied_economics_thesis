My study analyzes the responses of Hungarian sectors to monetary changes based on the theoretical model by Sayed H. Saghaian, Michael R. Reed, and Mary A. Marchant (2002), as well as the empirical model and conclusions by Zolt√°n Bakucs (2012). In the empirical section, I apply the Johansen cointegration test and error correction model.
