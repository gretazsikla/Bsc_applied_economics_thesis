# Responses of Agricultural and Industrial Prices to Monetary Shocks
## Abstract
My study analyzes the responses of Hungarian sectors to monetary changes based on the theoretical model by Sayed H. Saghaian, Michael R. Reed, and Mary A. Marchant (2002), as well as the empirical model and conclusions by Zoltán Bakucs (2012). In the empirical section, I apply the Johansen cointegration test and error correction model. Based on previous research findings, I hypothesize that the prices in the agricultural sector adjust more quickly to monetary shocks than industrial prices and that they overshoot in the short term.

The results generally do not support my hypothesis. However, when I narrow the time series to the end of 2019, excluding the economically uncertain years that followed, I obtain results similar to those of Zoltán Bakucs (2012). It can be assumed that after the economic shocks, the time series transitioned to a new long-term equilibrium path.

## Research motivation
In my research, I aim to examine the relationship between agricultural and industrial producer price indices and changes in the money supply. The relevance of this study is justified, on the one hand, by the fact that the agricultural producer price index impacts the consumer price index and, consequently, the entire population. The topic has become particularly relevant due to the high inflation environment of recent periods. On the other hand, the altered macroeconomic conditions caused by the Russian-Ukrainian war raise the need to revisit previously accepted facts.

My hypothesis is that monetary shocks are transmitted quickly and significantly to agricultural sector prices and that the agricultural sector responds more rapidly to financial shocks than industrial prices. The two main academic works that form the foundation of my study are those of Zoltán Bakucs (2012) and Sayed H. Saghaian, Michael R. Reed, and Mary A. Marchant (2002). Zoltán Bakucs, too, analyzes the Hungarian economy's responses to financial shocks based on the theoretical model developed by Saghaian and colleagues (2002).

## Literature Review
Saghaian and colleagues’ theoretical model assumes a small open economy, yet their research focused on the United States from 1975 to 1999, which presents a limitation to their findings. The model is not applicable to large countries because monetary shocks in a large economy would have an impact on other countries as well. The time series exhibit fluctuations that are more significant in the agricultural price index compared to the industrial price index. The greater variance may be explained by the overshooting of agricultural prices.

Overshooting refers to a temporary price change that exceeds its equilibrium state. The theory of overshooting was initially used to explain the volatility of foreign exchange markets and was later extended by Saghaian and colleagues to agricultural sectors based on Dornbusch’s (1976) overshooting theory.

Frankel (1986) introduced the concepts of fixed-price and flexible-price sectors. In fixed-price sectors, prices adjust slowly (are inelastic) to changes in the money supply, whereas in flexible-price sectors, prices adjust quickly (are elastic). Saghaian and colleagues categorized agricultural prices under the flexible-price group and industrial prices under the fixed-price group. Their theoretical model is based on the following equations:


# Fundamental Equations of the Theoretical Model

![Equations of the thereotical model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gretazsikla/Bsc_applied_economics_thesis/main/Modells_thesis.PNG)

The first equation indicates that, in contrast to agricultural products, the level of the manufacturing process is determined by its past level. In the case of oversupply, it can only adapt slowly. The second equation incorporates the assumption of rational expectations. The assumption of rational expectations allows the expected exchange rate change to be equal to the actual exchange rate change. The fourth equation represents the uncovered interest rate parity, which states that the domestic yield equals the global yield (exogenous) and the expected exchange rate change (domestic currency/foreign currency). The second and fourth equations jointly imply that domestic bonds are perfect substitutes for foreign bonds. In other words, any difference in the offered nominal yields is exactly offset by the expected exchange rate change.

The third equation represents the LM curve. In the fifth equation, the consumer price index consists of fixed-price industrial products and services, as well as flex-price goods and imports. α_1 represents the proportion of domestic industrial products and services, α_2 represents the proportion of domestic goods, and, (〖1-α〗_1-α_2) represents the proportion of imports in the domestic consumer price index.  It is assumed that domestic goods are not perfect substitutes for imported goods.

The sixth equation indicates that the supply of flex-price products is fixed at level "A," their natural level, and that here demand equals supply. The demand for flex-price products depends on relative prices, real returns, and income. The seventh equation describes the aggregate demand for industrial products, which depends on relative prices, real returns, and income. The assumptions of the theoretical model are not closely related to my results, but they are an important part of the analysis as theoretical background and as a limitation of the model.

The small-country assumption allows for the arbitrary selection of p* and r*. For simplicity, these are set to zero. Similarly, y, ym and A are assumed to have constant values of zero. After rearranging the equations, the following results are obtained. Monetary expansion reduces interest rates and, in the long term, leads to currency depreciation. These factors diminish the attractiveness of domestic financial products, resulting in capital outflows and a depreciation of the current exchange rate. According to Dornbusch's (1976) explanation, monetary easing causes an immediate depreciation in the spot exchange rate, which exceeds the long-term depreciation. This is because only under such circumstances will people anticipate an appreciation of the currency, compensating them for the reduced returns on domestic financial products. In this model, agricultural prices increase more significantly than expected relative to changes in the money supply, overshooting their new long-term equilibrium. In the analysis of overshooting, an important factor is the speed at which a variable converges back to its long-term trajectory after a shock.

In their empirical analysis, Saghaian et al. (2002) found that agricultural prices respond more quickly to shocks, including monetary shocks, than industrial prices, which affects relative prices in the short term. However, their results do not align with the long-term neutrality hypothesis of money. A 1% increase in the money supply leads to less than a 1% increase in both time series. As a conclusion, they note that the short- and long-term effects of monetary policy contribute to price and income instability and have a significant impact on the financial stability of farmers. Farmers naturally have the opportunity to reduce risks, but these cannot completely eliminate price and income risks. Therefore, monetary policy decisions require particular attention in order to reduce volatility and fluctuations in agricultural market prices.

Zoltán Bakucs (2012) used the model from the aforementioned research but examined Hungary between 1997 and 2004. Aligning with the theoretical model, he found that in the error correction model, the error correction terms for industrial and agricultural prices, as well as the exchange rate, are negative, meaning these variables return to the long-term path after a monetary shock. All variables are significant, except for the industrial price index. The adjustment speed parameter for the agricultural price index is larger in absolute value than the one for the industrial price index, meaning agricultural prices return to their original path faster, which is consistent with the theoretical model.

## About the Data
Since I am following the models of Zoltán Bakucs (2012) and Saghaian et al. (2002), I will examine the time series of the industrial producer price index, the agricultural industrial price index, the M1 money aggregate, and the euro-to-huf exchange rate. The M1 money aggregate represents the value of cash and demand deposits outside of monetary institutions, and the data is expressed in milliard of Hungarian forints. "The industrial producer price index measures the monthly change in the producer prices of goods produced by producers and the related services."  The industrial producer price index observes the basic prices excluding VAT at the time of sale for designated companies in the mining, manufacturing, energy, water, and waste management sectors, covering nearly 5900 products on a monthly basis . The agricultural producer price index shows the changes in the prices paid to agricultural producers for products bought for resale or processing, as well as products directly sold to the public for consumption . I downloaded the industrial and agricultural producer price indices from the Central Statistical Office’s information database, and the M1 money aggregate and exchange rate from the website of the Hungarian National Bank. I will convert all time series into base indices with the base year of 2005. The intersection of the four time series spans from January 2008 to November 2023, during which data is available on a monthly basis, so I have a total of 191 observations, which can be considered a large sample. The literature examines data between 1997 and 2004, so there is no overlap in time between the two studies.
