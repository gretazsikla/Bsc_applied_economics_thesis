# Responses of Agricultural and Industrial Prices to Monetary Shocks
## Abstract
My study analyzes the responses of Hungarian sectors to monetary changes based on the theoretical model by Sayed H. Saghaian, Michael R. Reed, and Mary A. Marchant (2002), as well as the empirical model and conclusions by Zoltán Bakucs (2012). In the empirical section, I apply the Johansen cointegration test and error correction model. Based on previous research findings, I hypothesize that the prices in the agricultural sector adjust more quickly to monetary shocks than industrial prices and that they overshoot in the short term.

The results generally do not support my hypothesis. However, when I narrow the time series to the end of 2019, excluding the economically uncertain years that followed, I obtain results similar to those of Zoltán Bakucs (2012). It can be assumed that after the economic shocks, the time series transitioned to a new long-term equilibrium path.

## Research motivation
In my research, I aim to examine the relationship between agricultural and industrial producer price indices and changes in the money supply. The relevance of this study is justified, on the one hand, by the fact that the agricultural producer price index impacts the consumer price index and, consequently, the entire population. The topic has become particularly relevant due to the high inflation environment of recent periods. On the other hand, the altered macroeconomic conditions caused by the Russian-Ukrainian war raise the need to revisit previously accepted facts.

My hypothesis is that monetary shocks are transmitted quickly and significantly to agricultural sector prices and that the agricultural sector responds more rapidly to financial shocks than industrial prices. The two main academic works that form the foundation of my study are those of Zoltán Bakucs (2012) and Sayed H. Saghaian, Michael R. Reed, and Mary A. Marchant (2002). Zoltán Bakucs, too, analyzes the Hungarian economy's responses to financial shocks based on the theoretical model developed by Saghaian and colleagues (2002).

## Literature Review
Saghaian and colleagues’ theoretical model assumes a small open economy, yet their research focused on the United States from 1975 to 1999, which presents a limitation to their findings. The model is not applicable to large countries because monetary shocks in a large economy would have an impact on other countries as well. The time series exhibit fluctuations that are more significant in the agricultural price index compared to the industrial price index. The greater variance may be explained by the overshooting of agricultural prices.

Overshooting refers to a temporary price change that exceeds its equilibrium state. The theory of overshooting was initially used to explain the volatility of foreign exchange markets and was later extended by Saghaian and colleagues to agricultural sectors based on Dornbusch’s (1976) overshooting theory.

Frankel (1986) introduced the concepts of fixed-price and flexible-price sectors. In fixed-price sectors, prices adjust slowly (are inelastic) to changes in the money supply, whereas in flexible-price sectors, prices adjust quickly (are elastic). Saghaian and colleagues categorized agricultural prices under the flexible-price group and industrial prices under the fixed-price group. Their theoretical model is based on the following equations:
